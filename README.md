## Features

- **Magnetic Reconnection Prediction:** Our platform utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the occurrence of magnetic reconnection events.
  
- **Solar Activity Analysis:** Explore the relationship between solar activity and Earth's seasons and solar seasons.

- **Solar Wind Data:** Easily access crucial solar wind data for monitoring space weather conditions.

- **Magnetosphere Insights:** Visualize and analyze Earth's magnetosphere in response to solar activity.

- **Interactive User Interface:** An intuitive web-based interface built with SvelteKit for exploring and visualizing satellite data.
